    <p>The wolf (Canis lupus), also known as the gray/grey wolf, is a canine native to the wilderness and remote areas
        of Eurasia and North America. It is the largest extant member of its family, with males averaging 43–45 kg
        (95–99 lb) and females 36–38.5 kg (79–85 lb). It is distinguished from other Canis species by its larger size
        and less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle. Its winter fur is long and bushy and
        predominantly a mottled gray in color, although nearly pure white, red and brown to black also occur. Mammal
        Species of the World (3rd ed., 2005), a standard reference work in zoology, recognises 38 subspecies of C.
        lupus.</p>
    <p>The wolf is the most specialized member of the genus Canis in the direction of cooperative big game hunting, as
        demonstrated by its morphological adaptations to tackling large prey, its more gregarious nature, and its highly
        advanced expressive behavior. It is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller Canis species, such as the
        coyote and golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids. It is the only species of Canis to have a range
        encompassing both Eurasia and North America, and originated in Eurasia during the Pleistocene, colonizing North
        America on at least three separate occasions during the Rancholabrean. It is a social animal, travelling in
        nuclear families consisting of a mated pair, accompanied by the pair's adult offspring. The wolf is typically an
        apex predator throughout its range. It feeds primarily on large wild ungulates, though it also eats smaller
        animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage. A seven-year-old wolf is considered to be relatively old, and the
        maximum lifespan is about 16 years.</p>
    <p>The global wolf population is estimated to be 300,000. The wolf is one of the world's best-known and
        most-researched animals, with probably more books written about it than any other wild species. It has a long
        history of association with humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of its
        attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies. Although
        the fear of wolves is pervasive in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been
        attributed to animals suffering from rabies. Non-rabid wolves have attacked and killed people, mainly children,
        but this is rare, as wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans from
        hunters and shepherds.</p>
